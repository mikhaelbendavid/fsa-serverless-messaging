# react-sls-messaging
Simple, functional messaging system w/notifications built in React with 5 Serverless Functions.

## Serverless Messaging in 5 Functions

# Tools
- Serverless framework
- AWS Lambda
- DynamoDB
- AWS Cognito

# Process

1. `$ npm install` package.json in root.
2. Update serverless.yml with service-name, preferred region.
3. Create two AWS DynamoDB Tables, with the following attributes:
Messages
ThreadId (PrimaryAttribute Key)| MessageId | SenderId | RecipientId | Content | Attachment | CreatedAt
4. Notifications
RecipientId | SenderId | NotificationId | NotificationMessage | CreatedAt | Thread | Unread
5. Deploy SLS functions with SLS Deploy

## To-Do

1. Front-end implementation (Coming Soon)
2. ApiGateway helper function for authentication using AWS Sig4 for IaM.
3. Kinesis Stream implementation to enable 'real-time' chat.


# Shoutout to Anomaly Innovations
They made a a great ES7 starter pack, which I have modified to remove a few things to decrease complexity & increase security. I've removed the information about setting sls .env variables, as I would not recommend defining them in the serverless.yml file. Instead, use AWS Parameter Store, store the environment variables as encrypted keys for maximum security. I've also removed serverless-offline.

Below are the docs that were included from Anomaly Innovation!

# Serverless Node.js Starter

A Serverless starter that adds ES7 syntax, serverless-offline, environment variables, and unit test support. Part of the [Serverless Stack](http://serverless-stack.com) guide.

[Serverless Node.js Starter](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-nodejs-starter) uses the [serverless-webpack](https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack) plugin, [Babel](https://babeljs.io), [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline), and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). It supports:

- **ES7 syntax in your handler functions**
  - Use `import` and `export`
- **Package your functions using Webpack**
- **Run API Gateway locally**
  - Use `serverless offline start`
- **Support for unit tests**
  - Run `npm test` to run your tests
- **Sourcemaps for proper error messages**
  - Error message show the correct line numbers
  - Works in production with CloudWatch
- **Automatic support for multiple handler files**
  - No need to add a new entry to your `webpack.config.js`
- **Add environment variables for your stages**


### Requirements

- [Install the Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)
- [Configure your AWS CLI](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/)

### Installation

To create a new Serverless project.

``` bash
$ serverless install --url https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-nodejs-starter --name my-project
```

Enter the new directory

``` bash
$ cd my-project
```

Install the Node.js packages

``` bash
$ npm install
```

### Usage

To run unit tests on your local

``` bash
$ npm test
```

To run a function on your local

``` bash
$ serverless invoke local --function hello
```

To simulate API Gateway locally using [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline)

``` bash
$ serverless offline start
```

Run your tests

``` bash
$ npm test
```

We use Jest to run our tests. You can read more about setting up your tests [here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html#content).

Deploy your project

``` bash
$ serverless deploy
```

Deploy a single function

``` bash
$ serverless deploy function --function hello
```

To add another function as a new file to your project, simply add the new file and add the reference to `serverless.yml`. The `webpack.config.js` automatically handles functions in different files.

To add environment variables to your project

1. Rename `env.example` to `env.yml`.
2. Add environment variables for the various stages to `env.yml`.
3. Uncomment `environment: ${file(env.yml):${self:provider.stage}}` in the `serverless.yml`.
4. Make sure to not commit your `env.yml`.
